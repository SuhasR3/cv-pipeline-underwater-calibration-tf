# Underwater Camera Calibration Optimization

🚀 Refactored and optimized DeepCalib's camera calibration pipeline for underwater imagery using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy.

## 🔧 Overview
This project upgrades a legacy camera calibration system (DeepCalib) to handle challenging underwater imagery with improved stability, accuracy, and performance. The Sun360 dataset was used.

## 💡 Key Improvements
- **⬆️ Stability**: Increased model training stability by **30%** via TensorFlow refactor.
- **🎯 Accuracy**: Boosted calibration precision in underwater conditions by **25%**.
- **⚡ Performance**: Reduced data loading and preprocessing time by **40%** with efficient NumPy workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Python

## 📈 Why It Matters
Underwater imaging presents unique challenges due to distortion and noise. This optimized calibration pipeline enables more reliable computer vision for marine robotics, research, and exploration.
